->Lazy Loading / Code splitting
Lazy loading is a technique for waiting to load certain parts of a webpage — especially images — 
until they are needed. Instead of loading everything all at once, known as "eager" loading, the 
browser does not request certain resources until the user interacts in such a way that the resources 
are needed. It consist of 3 parts:
1. Importing the component
2. Suspense
3. Error Boundary
